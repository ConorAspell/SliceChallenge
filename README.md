Give Instructions to a Pizza Bot

Program would receive an input like "5x5 (1, 3) (4, 4) (4, 2) (4, 2) (0, 1) (3, 2) (2, 3) (4, 1)" that would denote a 
cartesian plane and points on that plane.

The Program would need to give instructions to the bot to execute to visit each location as quick as possible.

Example output for (0,0), (0,1), (1,3), (2,3), (4,4), (4,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,2) would be N D W N N D W D W W N D S S D D S D E N D where
D = "Delivery".
